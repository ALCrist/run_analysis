 This script downloads a zip file containing measurements from wearable computing devices and extracts the mean 
 and standard deviation for each measurement using the following steps:
1.	Sets working directory.
2.	Installs libraries of packages needed to perform work.
1.	Downloads and installs the .zip file to data folder if it doesn't already exist in working directory.
3.	Adds data folder to working directory.
4.	Retrieves features to be used as column headings; creates mean/std column filter.
5.	Retrieves activity descriptions.
6.	Determines dataset's variable classes.
7.	Combines test and train subject tables.
8.	Combines test and train activity labels and adds activity description to labels.
9.	Combines test and train datasets and adds activity labels and subjects to dataset.
10.	Creates tidy dataset by doing the following:
11.	Groups data by feature measurements:
i.	Separates feature measurement column into 3 columns:  
i.	feature, 
ii.	axis and 
iii.	measure.
ii.	Groups the data observations by activity, subject, feature, axis and measure.
iii.	Calculates the averages (mean) for the mean and std measurement values.
iv.	Moves the average mean and std observations to 2 columns.
12.	Write the tidy dataset to a .txt file in the working directory.
